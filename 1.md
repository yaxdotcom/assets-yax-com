## Technologies we need

Features recently added to web browsers, along with innovations in infrastructure, reduce our need for frameworks and build tools, which can lead to a better web.

### ES6 Modules

All mature programming languages have a mechanism for “includes” or “imports” that make modular programming possible by splitting programs among multiple files. Early JavaScript didn’t directly support modular programming. In 2015, JavaScript ES6 was released with support for importing modules. Modern browsers now support _ES6 modules_, which makes modular JavaScript and HTML possible. And module CDNs are now available for code sharing.

### Module CDNs

What are _module CDNs_? They are content delivery networks such as [JSPM](https://jspm.org/) and [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) that deliver any package from NPM for use in vanilla JavaScript using ES6 module imports without build tools. JavaScript has had NPM, the Node Package Manager, since 2011, but until recently JavaScript packages from NPM had to be downloaded and processed with build tools. Module CDNs greatly simplify use of JavaScript software libraries, especially when combined with web components.

### Web components

_Web components_ is a broad term that refers to three specifications:
- custom elements
- shadow DOM
- a template mechanism

> Web components are ready &hellip; Custom elements allow web developers to define new HTML tags

Web components became possible when ES6 module imports were added to JavaScript. From there, it took five years for the web components specification suite to be implemented in all browsers. In January 2020 Microsoft released a version of its Edge browser that is based on Chromium, making web components available in all major browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Web components got some attention in 2014 and then were largely forgotten because of premature hype. This may be controversial, but I’m willing to make the case: Web components are ready and far more useful than currently recognized. Still, I don’t write about “web components” per se. As far as I’m concerned, shadow DOM and the template mechanism are just implementation details that make custom HTML elements possible. _Custom HTML elements_ are important and key to writing modular HTML without frameworks, so to avoid confusion I write about using custom HTML elements, not web components.

Custom elements allow web developers to define new HTML tags encapsulating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that we can drop anywhere on our own web pages or share with others. Building custom elements requires JavaScript skills but they make HTML modular, extensible, and reusable. Once built, they are as easy to use as standard HTML tags.

All these recent innovations are wonderful but the not as important as how we use them. That’s why I’ve gathered together the principles of the **_Yax Way_**. Read on for the principles.
