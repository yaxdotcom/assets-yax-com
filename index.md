> &hellip; the technologies we choose to build web applications influence more than just software architecture

I now understand the technologies we choose to build web applications influence more than just software architecture. It’s a bit like Conway’s law but at a macro level. The size of teams, skill specialization, organization structure, inclusiveness, and business model of organizations that contribute to the growth of the web is deeply influenced by the software systems that we use to build web applications. In turn, we have a worldwide web dominated by the type of organizations required to support the applications we build. If web application development were simple and the skills needed were a superset of HTML, a hundred thousand flowers would bloom and the web could be a garden like a long-forgotten GeoCities. As it is, we have Facebook, because, well, we need FAANG-salaried engineers to build web applications given the software we have. In turn, Facebook gave us React, which is the complex web application framework most new developers want to learn right now. Judging from the number of developers using React, there seems to be no other way to build web applications.

Tech writing often requires a code block:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

And links are important, too: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
